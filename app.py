STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES:
- Use vocabulary suitable for Band {band}: {instructions['vocab']}
- Sentence structure must match Band {band}: {instructions['structure']}
- Cohesion must be appropriate: {instructions['cohesion']}
- Length requirement: {instructions['length']}
- Error level: {instructions['errors']}
- Ensure connector count is at least 12 for Band 8, 10 for Band 7, and 8 for Band 6.
- Ensure repeated words are less than 3 for Band 8, less than 5 for Band 7, and less than 7 for Band 6.
- DO NOT exceed the expected complexity for Band {band}.
-Generate the essay based on the FOLLOWING THESE RULES to get the exact band score you generated in the analysis result:
1. Grammar Issues: Give ONLY Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor
-Classify the grammar quality of the essay as:
Must be exactly error in these ranges
for band 9:<2 grammar issues => Excellent
for band 8:4-6 grammar issues => Good
for band 7:8-9 grammar issues=> Fair
for band 6:11-13 grammar issues=> Fair
for band 5:14-16 grammar issues => Poor
for band 4:18-20 grammar issues => Poor
for band 3:>22 grammar issues => Poor

2. Connector Count: Classify as based on the number of connectors (e.g., however, furthermore, and).
Classify the essay based on the number of connectors (e.g., "however," "furthermore," "and") (count conjunction words):
for band 3:<2 connectors => Low
for band 4:3-4 connectors => Low
for band 5:5-7 connectors => Low
for band 6:8-10 connectors => Medium
for band 7:10-12 connectors => Medium
for band 8:13-15 connectors => High
for band 9:>16 connectors => High
3. Repeated Words: Classify as Low/Medium/High based on the number of repeated nouns/verbs.
Low: 0-3 repeated words for band 9 and 8
Medium: 4-5 repeated words for band 7, 6, 5
High: 6+ repeated words for band 4, 3
Double-check the essay to ensure consistency when evaluating the same essay multiple times.
4. Advanced Vocabulary: Low/Medium/Advanced (double-check to ensure the same result on the same essay) (advanced vocabulary determined by the complexity of the terms used in the essay)
Low: <3 advanced words for band 3, 4
Medium: 5 <= advanced words <= 10 for band 5, 6, 7
Advanced: >=11 advanced words (must use more than 12 words for band 9) for band 8, 9
Double-check the essay to ensure consistency when evaluating the same essay multiple times.

5. Lexical Diversity: Low/Medium/Advanced (calculate Lexical Density:
    * Count all words in the essay.
    * Classify each word as either a CONTENT word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) or a FUNCTION word (article, preposition, conjunction, pronoun, auxiliary verb). If a word can be both, consider its usage in the context.
    * Calculate Lexical Density = (Number of Content Words) / (Total Number of Words)
    * Provide the Lexical Density score as a decimal number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.55).
    * Also, indicate whether the Lexical Diversity is Low, Medium, or High based on these ranges:
        * Low: Lexical Density < 0.40 for band 3, 4
        * Medium: 0.40 <= Lexical Density < 0.60 for band 5, 6, 7
        * High: Lexical Density >= 0.60 for band 8, 9
6. Avg Sentence Length: Short (5-10) / Medium (11-20) / Long (20+) (calculate with Average Sentence Length = Total Number of Words / Total Number of Sentences)
Short: 5-10 words per sentence for band 3, 4
Medium: 11-20 words per sentence for band 5, 6, 7
Long: 20+ words per sentence for band 8, 9
7. Predicted Band: 3-9 (decimal can be included, e.g., 9.0)

- Reduce repeats: {analysis.get('Repeated Words', 'Low')} instances
- Add connectors: Current {analysis.get('Connector Count', 'Low')}
- Enhance vocabulary: {analysis.get('Advanced Vocabulary', 'Low')}
-with these rules
1. Grammar Issues: Give ONLY Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor
-Classify the grammar quality of the essay as:
Excellent: 0-1 minor errors
Good: 2-3 minor errors
Fair: 4-5 errors or noticeable grammar issues
Poor: 6+ errors or significant grammar problems
Double-check the essay to ensure consistency when evaluating the same essay multiple times.

2. Connector Count: Classify as Low/Medium/High based on the number of connectors (e.g., however, furthermore, and).
Classify the essay based on the number of connectors (e.g., "however," "furthermore," "and"):
Low: 0-5 connectors
Medium: 6-12 connectors
High: 13+ connectors
Double-check the essay to ensure consistency when evaluating the same essay multiple times.

3. Repeated Words: Classify as Low/Medium/High based on the number of repeated nouns/verbs.
Low: 0-2 repeated words
Medium: 3-4 repeated words
High: 5+ repeated words
Double-check the essay to ensure consistency when evaluating the same essay multiple times.

4. Advanced Vocabulary: Low/Medium/Advanced (double-check for consistency).
- Advanced Vocabulary is determined by the complexity of the terms used in the essay:
  - Low: Frequent use of simple words
  - Medium: A mix of everyday and slightly more advanced terms
  - Advanced: Use of sophisticated terms, formal language, and specialized vocabulary
- Double-check the essay to ensure consistency when evaluating the same essay multiple times.

5. Lexical Diversity: Low/Medium/High (calculate Lexical Density):
  - Count all words in the essay.
  - Classify each word as either a CONTENT word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) or a FUNCTION word (article, preposition, conjunction, pronoun, auxiliary verb). If a word can be both, consider its usage in the context.
  - Calculate Lexical Density = (Number of Content Words) / (Total Number of Words)
  - Provide the Lexical Density score as a decimal number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.55).
  - Indicate whether the Lexical Diversity is:
    - Low: Lexical Density < 0.40
    - Medium: 0.40 <= Lexical Density < 0.60
    - High: Lexical Density >= 0.60

6. Avg Sentence Length: Short (5-10) / Medium (11-20) / Long (20+) (calculate with Average Sentence Length = Total Number of Words / Total Number of Sentences):
  - Short: 5-10 words per sentence
  - Medium: 11-20 words per sentence
  - Long: 20+ words per sentence

7. Predicted Band: 3-9 (decimal can be included, e.g., 9.0)

Score calculation to update the essay:
- Grammar Issues:
  - Excellent: 5
  - Good: 4
  - Fair: 3
  - Poor: 2
- Connector Count:
  - Low: 2
  - Medium: 4
  - High: 5
- Repeated Words:
  - Low: 5

- Lexical Diversity:
  - Low: 2
  - Medium: 4
  - High: 5
- Average Sentence Length:
  - Short: 3
  - Medium: 4
  - Long: 5

Breakdown for Band Ranges:
- Band 3 (3.0 - 4.5): Score: 6 to 15 points
- Band 4 (4.0 - 5.0): Score: 16 to 19 points
- Band 5 (5.0 - 6.0): Score: 20 to 22 points
- Band 6 (6.0 - 6.5): Score: 23 to 24 points
- Band 7 (7.0 - 8.0): Score: 25 to 27 points
- Band 8 (8.0 - 9.0): Score: 28 to 29 points
- Band 9 (9.0): Score: 30 points

- Don’t show results, show only a plain essay based on the above rules. Do not include analysis or additional comments (e.g., Grammar Issues: Excellent, Predicted Band: 9.0).
